==================================
Python AWIPS Data Access Framework 
==================================

The python-awips package provides a data access framework for requesting meteorological and geographic datasets from an `EDEX <http://unidata.github.io/awips2/#edex>`_ server.

`AWIPS <http://unidata.github.io/awips2>`_ is a weather display and analysis package developed by the National Weather Service for operational forecasting.  UCAR's `Unidata Program Center <http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/awips2/>`_ supports a non-operational open-source release of the AWIPS software (`EDEX <http://unidata.github.io/awips2/#edex>`_, `CAVE <http://unidata.github.io/awips2/#cave>`_, and `python-awips <https://github.com/Unidata/python-awips>`_).
