1 Imports
---------

The imports below are used throughout the notebook. The python-awips
imports allow us to connect to an EDEX server, use the warning lookup
dictionary, and define a TimeRange. The additional imports are for data
manipulation and visualization.

.. code:: ipython3

    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import cartopy.crs as ccrs
    import cartopy.feature as cfeature
    from cartopy.feature import ShapelyFeature, NaturalEarthFeature
    from cartopy.mpl.gridliner import LONGITUDE_FORMATTER, LATITUDE_FORMATTER
    from shapely.geometry import MultiPolygon, Polygon
    
    from awips.dataaccess import DataAccessLayer
    from awips.tables import vtec
    from dynamicserialize.dstypes.com.raytheon.uf.common.time import TimeRange

`Top <https://unidata.github.io/python-awips/examples/generated/Watch_Warning_and_Advisory_Plotting.html>`__

--------------

2 Function: make_map()
----------------------

In order to plot more than one image, it’s easiest to define common
logic in a function. However, for this notebook we only use it in one
place. It is a function you will find in most of our example notebooks.

Here, a new function called **make_map** is defined. This function uses
the `matplotlib.pyplot package
(plt) <https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html>`__
to create a figure and axis. The lat/lon grids are added.

.. code:: ipython3

    def make_map(bbox, projection=ccrs.PlateCarree()):
        fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,12),
                subplot_kw=dict(projection=projection))
        ax.set_extent(bbox)
        gl = ax.gridlines(draw_labels=True)
        gl.top_labels = gl.right_labels = False
        gl.xformatter = LONGITUDE_FORMATTER
        gl.yformatter = LATITUDE_FORMATTER
        return fig, ax

`Top <https://unidata.github.io/python-awips/examples/generated/Watch_Warning_and_Advisory_Plotting.html>`__

--------------

3 Function: get_color()
-----------------------

Since we’ll be needing to access the color using the vtec lookup table
in several places, creating an easily recognizable function is useful.

.. code:: ipython3

    def get_color(phensig):
        return vtec[phensig]['color']

`Top <https://unidata.github.io/python-awips/examples/generated/Watch_Warning_and_Advisory_Plotting.html>`__

--------------

4 Function get_title()
----------------------

Similar to the color function just defined, accessing the full name for
the phensig will also be necessary, so this function will be helpful.

.. code:: ipython3

    def get_title(phensig):
        return vtec[phensig]['hdln']

`Top <https://unidata.github.io/python-awips/examples/generated/Watch_Warning_and_Advisory_Plotting.html>`__

--------------

5 Initial Setup
---------------

5.1 EDEX Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First we establish a connection to Unidata’s public EDEX server. With
that connection made, we can create a `new data request
object <http://unidata.github.io/python-awips/api/IDataRequest.html>`__
and set the data type to **warning**, and set the Parameters to
**phensig** and **sig**.

.. container:: alert-info

   Note: Remember, to see all available parameters use the
   DataAccess.getAvailableParameters() method as shown in the Grid
   Levels and Parameters Notebook.

.. code:: ipython3

    DataAccessLayer.changeEDEXHost("edex-cloud.unidata.ucar.edu")
    request = DataAccessLayer.newDataRequest()
    request.setDatatype("warning")
    params = ["phensig", "sig"]
    request.setParameters(*(params))

5.2 Significance (Sig) Constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The two parameters we’re requesting for our warning objects are
**phensig** and **sig** where phensig is styled “XX.Y” and sig is “Y”.
Phen stands for “Phenomena” and sig stands for “Significance”. `A more
detailed description of phensigs and how they’re used is provided with
this NWS
pamphlet <https://www.weather.gov/media/vtec/VTEC_explanation4-20.pdf>`__.

The constants in this section correlate the **sig** to what type of
message it is (what significance it is).

.. code:: ipython3

    WATCH_SIG = 'A'
    WARN_SIG = 'W'
    ADVIS_SIG = 'Y'
    STATEM_SIG = 'S'

`Top <https://unidata.github.io/python-awips/examples/generated/Watch_Warning_and_Advisory_Plotting.html>`__

--------------

6 Filter by Time
----------------

Here we decide how much data we want to pull from EDEX. By default we’ll
request 12 hours, but that value can easily be modified by `adjusting
the
``timedelta(hours = 12)`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects>`__
in line ``2``. The more data we request, the longer the next section
will take to run.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Get records from the last 12 hours
    lastHourDateTime = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(hours = 12)
    start = lastHourDateTime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    end = datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    
    beginRange = datetime.strptime( start , "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    endRange = datetime.strptime( end , "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    timerange = TimeRange(beginRange, endRange)

`Top <https://unidata.github.io/python-awips/examples/generated/Watch_Warning_and_Advisory_Plotting.html>`__

--------------

7 Use the Data!
---------------

7.1 Get the Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have our ``request`` and TimeRange ``timerange`` objects
ready, it’s time to request the data array from EDEX.

.. container:: alert-info

   Note: Above we set timerange to be 12 hours worth of data. This can
   return on the order of ~2000 records and can take a little while to
   run.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Get response
    response = DataAccessLayer.getGeometryData(request, timerange)
    print("Using " + str(len(response)) + " records")


.. parsed-literal::

    Using 1502 records


7.2 Extract Phensigs, Geometries, and Times
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we start gathering all the information we’ll need to
properly display our data. First we create an array to keep track of
unique phensigs. This is useful summary information and will be used to
help create the legend which we’ll display along with our plot.

Next, we create arrays for each of the 4 types of significance a
statement can have. We will group our records this way, so we can easily
toggle which records to display or not.

Then, we create two time variables to keep track of the earliest time
from our records and the latest time, and will display that information
in the title of our plot.

This section has optional print statements at lines ``65`` and ``85``.
The first prints out the title, phensig, ref time, and shape for each
unique phensig, and the second prints out a sum of how many unique
phensigs there are.

We cycle through all the data produced from our ``response`` object,
access its geometries, and create a new
`ShapelyFeature <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/reference/generated/cartopy.feature.ShapelyFeature.html>`__
with the corresponding color. Then we place this new feature in the
appropriate ``shapes`` array. During this process we also populate the
phensigs array with all unique phensig entries.

Finally, after we’re done looping through all the ``response`` data, we
create a mapping of phensigs to their corresponding titles. This will be
used later to sort the legend alphabetically by titles (which differs
from simply sorting by phensig). Ex. *Blizzard Warning (BZ.W)* would
come before *Areal Flood Advisory (FA.Y)* if we simply sorted by
phensig.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Keep track of unique phensigs, to use in legend
    phensigs = []
    
    # Sort the geometries based on their sig
    watch_shapes = []
    warning_shapes = []
    advisory_shapes = []
    statement_shapes = []
    
    # Keep track of the earliest and latest reftime for title
    # start with the first time from the first object in the response
    time_str = str(response[0].getDataTime().getRefTime())
    # truncate the decimal seconds for datetime parsing
    time_str = time_str[:-4]
    # convert to datetime object for easy comparison
    first_time = datetime.strptime(time_str, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    last_time = datetime.strptime(time_str, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    
    for ob in response:
        
        # get the geometry for the object
        poly = ob.getGeometry()
        # get the reftime for the object
        ref  = ob.getDataTime().getRefTime()
        
        # do not plot if phensig is blank (SPS)
        if ob.getString('phensig'):
            
            # look at the reftime
            # convert reftime to a string and parse the decimal seconds
            ref_str = str(ref)
            ref_str = ref_str[:-4]
            # convert reftime to a datetime object for comparison
            ref_time = datetime.strptime(ref_str, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
            # compare current time with first and last times and set if appropriate
            if ref_time is not None:
                if ref_time < first_time:
                    first_time = ref_time
                elif ref_time > last_time:
                    last_time = ref_time
            
            # get the phensig and sig values from object
            phensigString = ob.getString('phensig')
            sig = ob.getString('sig')
    
            # set the geometries based on whether it's a MultiPolygon or Polygon
            if poly.geom_type == 'MultiPolygon':
                geometries = np.array([])
                geometries = np.append(geometries,MultiPolygon(poly))
            else:
                geometries = np.array([])
                geometries = np.append(geometries,Polygon(poly))
    
            for geom in geometries:
                bounds = Polygon(geom)
                intersection = bounds.intersection
                geoms = (intersection(geom) for geom in geometries if bounds.intersects(geom))
        
            # Store the unique phensigs
            if not phensigString in phensigs:
                phensigs.append(phensigString)
                # Optional printout of unique Phensigs
    #             print(get_title(phensigString) + " (" + phensigString + ")
                
            # get the corresponding color using the dictionary
            color = get_color(phensigString)
            # create a new shape feature for the object
            shape_feature = ShapelyFeature(geoms,ccrs.PlateCarree(), 
                            facecolor=color, edgecolor=color)
            # store the shape feature in the correct array
            if sig is WARN_SIG:
                warning_shapes.append(shape_feature)
            elif sig is WATCH_SIG:
                watch_shapes.append(shape_feature)
            elif sig is ADVIS_SIG:
                advisory_shapes.append(shape_feature)
            elif sig is STATEM_SIG:
                statement_shapes.append(shape_feature)
    
    # Optional printout for the number of unique phensigs
    print(len(phensigs), " Unique Phensigs")
    
    # Map phensigs to their titles (used for displaying alphabetically by
    # title in legend)
    phensig_titles = {}
    for phensig in phensigs:
        key = get_title(phensig)

--------------

8 Plot the Data!
----------------

8.1 Create State and Political Boundaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Define the state and political boundaries that we’ll use in our plot to
give more of a frame of reference. These objects are standard method
calls in the `Cartopy Feature package, using the NaturalEarthFeature
function <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/v0.14/matplotlib/feature_interface.html#cartopy.feature.NaturalEarthFeature>`__.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Define the state and political boundaries for the plot  
    states_provinces = cfeature.NaturalEarthFeature(
            category='cultural',
            name='admin_1_states_provinces_lines',
            scale='50m',
            facecolor='none')
    political_boundaries = cfeature.NaturalEarthFeature(category='cultural',
                                   name='admin_0_boundary_lines_land',
                                   scale='50m', facecolor='none')

8.2 Draw the Plot and Legend for WWAs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is where we finally get ot draw something! The very first few lines
of this section are constants that we can manually “switch on and off”
for what records we want displayed. By default we have all significance
types drawn. If we want to “turn off” any of the significance records,
simply set it’s corresponding constant to false, and re-run this cell to
see how that plot compares.

The next step involves creating the objects that are used to define the
legend. We use the ``phensig_titles`` dictionary to loop through all the
phensigs in alphabetical (by title) order. Then, we compare if the
phensig will be displayed or not based on the display constants from the
previous lines. If the significance will be drawn then we create a new
`Patch
object <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.patches.Patch.html#matplotlib.patches.Patch>`__
of the corresponding color with the corresponding label and add it to
our ``handles`` array.

After that we define our bounding box and create our new plot with its
figure and axes.

Our next step is to create our Title for our plot. We create a title
based on the draw variables to accurately describe what is being drawn
in our plot. Here is where we use the first and last times defined in a
previous cell.

Finally, we create and show our plot. We add the title to the plot, add
all the features to the axes, and add the legend as well.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Set these variables for which records to draw
    DRAW_ADVISORY = True
    DRAW_WATCH = True
    DRAW_WARNING = True
    DRAW_STATEMENT = True
        
    # Create handles for legend and add items alphabetically by title and
    # only display based on the display values above
    handles = []
    for title in sorted(phensig_titles):
        phensig = phensig_titles[title]
        # check draw booleans
        if ( "."+ADVIS_SIG in phensig and DRAW_ADVISORY or 
            "."+WATCH_SIG in phensig and DRAW_WATCH or 
            "."+WARN_SIG in phensig and DRAW_WARNING or 
            "."+STATEM_SIG in phensig and DRAW_STATEMENT ):
            entry = mpatches.Patch(color=get_color(phensig), label=title)
            handles.append(entry)
    
    # Create the plot
    bbox=[-127,-64,24,49]
    fig, ax = make_map(bbox=bbox)
    
    # Add the title
    # Construct the title based on which record types are being displayed
    title_string = ""
    if DRAW_WATCH:
        title_string += "Watches, "
    if DRAW_WARNING:
        title_string += "Warnings, "
    if DRAW_ADVISORY:
        title_string += "Advisories, "
    if DRAW_STATEMENT:
        title_string += "Statements, "
    # remove the last comma and space
    title_string = title_string[:-2]
    # add the time range
    title_string += " from " + str(first_time)[:-3] + " to " + str(last_time)[:-3] + " UTC"
    # set the title on the plot, give it a bigger font size, and increase
    # the vertical padding between the title and the figure
    plt.title(title_string, fontsize=20, pad=10)
    
    # Draw all features on the plot
    ax.add_feature(cfeature.LAND)
    ax.add_feature(cfeature.COASTLINE)
    ax.add_feature(states_provinces, edgecolor='black')
    ax.add_feature(political_boundaries, edgecolor='black')
    
    # Draw WWAs in order: Advisory -> Watch > Warning > Statement
    if DRAW_ADVISORY:
        for shape in advisory_shapes:
            ax.add_feature(shape)
    if DRAW_WATCH:
        for shape in watch_shapes:
            ax.add_feature(shape)
    if DRAW_WARNING:
        for shape in warning_shapes:
            ax.add_feature(shape)
    if DRAW_STATEMENT:
        for shape in statement_shapes:
            ax.add_feature(shape)
        
    # Draw the legend
    # use the handles defined earlier for the color associations to
    # phensig titles, set the location to the lower center, give it
    # 5 columns so it uses all the horizonatal space, place it under
    # the actual figure, and give it a larger fontsize
    bottom = 0.12 + (len(handles)//5 *.04)
    ax.legend(handles=handles, loc='lower center', ncol=5, bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, -bottom), fontsize=16)
    
    # Show the plot
    plt.show()
